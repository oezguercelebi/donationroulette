# Charity Images

This directory should contain logo images for the charities referenced in `src/lib/charities.ts`.

Expected image files:
- water-org.png
- save-children.png
- doctors-borders.png
- wwf.png
- unicef.png
- acumen.png

You can add actual logo images for these charities here, or customize with your own charity logos.

Note: For the demo to work properly without actual images, the code includes fallback handling when images are not found.
